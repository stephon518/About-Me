# About Me


Hi I’m Stephon Knight Monroe,

I grew up in the Bay Area and currently attending code fellows online. Prior to starting code fellows, I attended Year Up Bay Area where I was trained hands-on from skilled developers with professional internships at some of the Bay Area’s top companies. I’m very motivated to complete this program and want to take full advantage of the opportunities this program will provide for me.

My goals that I have is to complete code fellows because I’ve always had a passion for technology and software development. I’m motivated to drive myself forward to complete tasks.
